<h1>Motivation</h1>

For my project, I aimed to analyze my interaction with competitive gaming and performance improvement over time. Since League of Legends (LoL) is my primary game of focus, I decided to base the analysis on my match and champion data.

The motivation for this project is to gain deeper insights into my gameplay patterns, including:

The champions I play most frequently.
* My match performances.
* My rank progression across different seasons.
* By analyzing this data, I aim to identify trends in my gameplay and areas for improvement.



<h1>Tools</h1>

I used the following tools and libraries to collect, process, and analyze my data:

Python: The primary programming language for data scraping, cleaning, and analysis.
Selenium: For automating data scraping from the web, including match history and champion data.
Pandas: For data cleaning, structuring, and transformation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization, including bar plots, line graphs, and scatter plots.
