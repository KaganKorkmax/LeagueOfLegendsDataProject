*Motivation*

For my project, I aimed to analyze my interaction with competitive gaming and performance improvement over time. Since League of Legends (LoL) is my primary game of focus, I decided to base the analysis on my match and champion data. The motivation for this project is to gain deeper insights into my gameplay patterns, including the champions I play most frequently, my match performances, and my rank progression across different seasons. By analyzing this data, I aim to identify trends in my gameplay and areas for improvement.
